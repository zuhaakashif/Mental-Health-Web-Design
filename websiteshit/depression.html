       <p> Throughout the course of our lives, we all experience episodes of stress, unhappiness, sadness, or grief. Often, when a loved one dies or we suffer a personal tragedy or difficulty such as divorce or loss of a job, we may feel depressed (some people call this "the blues"). Most of us are able to cope with these and other types of stressful events.<br>
            Over a period of days or weeks, the majority of us are able to return to our normal activities. But when these feelings of sadness and other symptoms make it hard for us to get through the day, and when the symptoms last for more than a couple of weeks in a row, we may have what is called "clinical depression." The term clinical depression is usually used to distinguish the illness of depression from less difficult feelings of sadness, gloom, or the blues.<br>
            Clinical depression is not just grief or feeling sad. It is an illness that can challenge your ability to perform even routine daily activities. At its worst, depression may lead you to contemplate, attempt, or commit suicide. Depression represents a burden for both you and your family. Sometimes that burden can seem overwhelming.
            <br>
            <br>
            There are several different types of clinical depression (mood disorders that include depressive symptoms) :
            <br>
            <br>
            Major depression is an episode of change in mood that lasts for weeks or months. It is one of the most severe types of depression. It usually involves a low or irritable mood and/or a loss of interest or pleasure in usual activities. It interferes with one's normal functioning and often includes physical symptoms. A person may experience only one episode of major depressive disorder, but often there are repeated episodes over an individual's lifetime.<br>
            Dysthymia, often commonly called melancholy, is less severe than major depression but usually goes on for a longer period, often several years. There are usually periods of feeling fairly normal between episodes of low mood. The symptoms usually do not completely disrupt one's normal activities.

           <h3>What Are The Symptoms And Signs Of Depression?

              In true depressive illnesses, the symptoms last weeks, months, or sometimes years if you don't seek treatment. If you are depressed, you are often unable to perform daily activities. You may not care enough to get out of bed or get dressed, much less work, do errands, or socialize.<br>
              You may be said to be suffering from a major depressive episode if you have a depressed mood for at least 2 weeks and have at least 5 of the following clinical symptoms:
             <br>
             <br>
               -Feeling sad or blue<br>
               -Crying spells<br>
               -Loss of interest or pleasure in usual activities<br>
               -Significant increase or decrease in appetite<br>
               -Significant weight loss or weight gain<br>
               -Change in sleep pattern: inability to sleep or excessive sleeping<br>
               -Agitation or irritability<br>
               -Fatigue or loss of energy<br>
               -A tendency to isolate from friends and family<br>
               -Trouble concentrating<br>
               -Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt<br>
               -Thoughts of death or suicide<br>
               <br>

           <h3>Can My Depression Be Treated?</h3>

            <br>
            If your symptoms indicate that you have clinical depression, your health-care provider will strongly recommend treatment. Treatment may include addressing any medical conditions that cause or worsen depression. For example, an individual who is found to have low levels of thyroid hormone might receive thyroid hormone replacement with levothyroxine (Synthroid, Levoxyl).<br>
            Other components of treatment include supportive therapy, such as changes in lifestyle and behavior, psychotherapy, complementary therapies, and may often include medication. If your symptoms of depression are severe enough to warrant treatment with medication, you are most likely to feel better faster and for longer when medication treatment is combined with psychotherapy.<br>
            Most practitioners will continue treatment of major depression for 6 months to a year. Treatment for teens with depression can have a significantly positive effect on the adolescent's functioning with peers, family, and at school. Without treatment, your symptoms will last much longer and may never get better. In fact, they may get worse. With treatment, your chances of recovery are quite good.<br>
            Therapy frequently includes antidepressant medication and supportive care such as psychotherapy. Other less widely used therapies, such as electroconvulsive therapy, are used in severe cases.<br>
            Therapy may be provided by your health-care provider or by a specially trained mental health professional. Psychiatrists are medical doctors who have completed specialized training in mental disorders. Psychologists are nonphysicians who have graduate (after college) and doctorate-level (Ph.D.) training that includes experience in mental-health-care facilities. Psychotherapists may have a degree in medicine (psychiatry), psychology, social work, nursing, mental health counseling, or couples and family therapy, as well as adding more specialized education or training.<br>
            Regardless of which treatment is used, psychotherapy, medication, or a combination, most people with depression can safely be treated in a series of office (outpatient) visits. Inpatient care (in the hospital) may be necessary for people with more serious symptoms and is required for those who are contemplating suicide or cannot care for themselves.<br>
