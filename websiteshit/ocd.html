            Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by the sufferer experiencing either obsessions or compulsions that occur repeatedly and persistently and interfere with their daily life.<br>
            Obsessions are recurrent thoughts or worries that intrude on the person's normal thinking and that the sufferer knows are excessive or unwarranted.<br>
            Compulsions are repetitive behaviors, loosely defined as habits that the sufferer feels compelled to perform and has difficulty resisting that are either done in response to obsessions or follow rigid rules. The individual with compulsions may even have anxiety to the point of having panic attacks if not allowed to engage in their compulsive behaviors.<br>
            A small percentage of the general population will likely develop OCD at some time in their life. It tends to run in families and to occur more often in women than men.<br>
            Some studies, however, indicate that OCD may be more prevalent in boys than girls.<br>
            There are many famous, accomplished people who suffer from OCD.<br>
            There are thought to be a number of types of OCD:<br>
            washing/cleaning and checking compulsions,
            symmetry, ordering, and arranging compulsions,
            hoarding obsessions,
            excessive sexual or religious thoughts,
            obsessions in the absence of compulsions,
            compulsions without obsessions.<br>
            Girls and women are more likely to have obsessions rather than compulsive behavior or a combination of the two types of symptoms as compared to OCD in males, who more likely suffer from isolated compulsions.<br>
            The time period soon after giving birth (postpartum) carries a higher risk of developing OCD for women.<br>
            Women who already suffer from avoidant or obsessive compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) are at even higher risk of developing postpartum obsessive compulsive disorder. Men may also develop postpartum OCD soon after their partners deliver.<br>

            Examples of compulsions include counting, repeating words or actions (for example, checking locks or hand washing), arranging things according to rigid rules, and praying. These behaviors are done for the purpose of preventing or decreasing anxiety or preventing an unrealistic dreaded event. An example of an unrealistic dreaded event is becoming ill if hands are washed less than once every half hour. The symptoms of OCD either significantly interfere with the sufferer's daily routine or functioning (for example, causing insomnia or difficulty concentrating at work), cause significant stress, or take up a lot of time.<br>
            <br>
            In contrast to symptoms of OCD in adults, those in children may include a lack of insight that their obsessions or compulsions are a problem. Symptoms in children may also include tantrums when the child's ability to engage in compulsions is prevented. Symptoms of OCD in teenagers often involve physical (somatic) complaints. While the severity of OCD symptoms can change in their level of severity, the kind of symptoms tends to change little in adults compared to children and teens.<br>

            Psychological treatments for OCD include cognitive-behavioral therapy, which helps the person counteract negative thoughts that lead to compulsions, as well as exposure and response-prevention therapies. Behavior modification therapy focuses on helping the OCD sufferer avoid and eventually extinguish the urges to engage in compulsive behaviors, while remaining free of anxiety. Examples of behavior therapies include response prevention, which involves delaying and eventually avoiding engaging in compulsions, and exposure, which allows the person with OCD to practice response prevention by repeatedly putting the person in a situation that may lend itself to engaging in compulsions. Children and adolescents tend to respond very well to exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy, whether it is provided on an individual basis with the family involved in treatment or care that is provided through group therapy.<br>
