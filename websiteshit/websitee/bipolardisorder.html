            Bipolar disorder (BD) is a psychiatric diagnosis that includes episodes with both mood changes and altered activity or energy. In the past, bipolar disorder was called manic depression (or affective psychosis in the 1800s). All of these names describe the episodes in bipolar disorder that include elevated mood and increased activity (or mania), often followed by periods of low mood (depression) disorder in the past. Bipolar disorder is a serious, often lifelong, mental illness that causes serious disruptions in lifestyle and health. However, there are effective treatments for bipolar disorder, and people with this diagnosis can live full and productive lives.<br>

            Following are the symptoms:
            <br> 
            <br>
            -Unrealistic plans, spending sprees, stealing, an increase in sexual affairs, or other reckless behavior, such as wild driving, also may occur.<br>
            -Disregard for the risks or dangers of these and other impulsive behaviors.<br>
            -A decreased want or need for sleep, different than insomnia (when a person wants to sleep, but can't, and feels tired).<br>
            -Increased goal-directed activity: starting lots of projects and tasks (but often not finishing any of them)<br>
            -The person with mania can stay up all night but may find that not much was accomplished because he or she was easily distracted.<br>
            -The person in a manic phase may talk very quickly and jump from subject to subject, as if his or her mouth can't keep up with the rapid thoughts (flight of ideas).<br>
            -The person may be unable to respond to social cues to stop talking, and other people can't get a word in (pressured speech).<br>
            -Increased physical activity, including fidgeting, restlessness, or hyperactivity, may be seen.<br>
            -Poor temper control and irritability can be especially upsetting to friends and loved ones.<br>
            -Self-esteem may be inflated. A person may have exaggerated sense of self-confidence and may inappropriately believe they have increased self-importance and abilities.<br>
            -Decisions regarding business and finances are often made hurriedly and without careful consideration; this poor judgment may be the result of inappropriate optimism.<br>
            -They are grandiose and may have delusions (false ideas) of grandeur (greatness).<br>
            -In severe cases, delusions (false, fixed beliefs) and hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't real) may be seen.<br>
            -Hypomania refers to a milder form of mania. People affected by this mood disorder have many of the same features as those with mania, to lesser extremes, without the negative impact on day-to-day functioning. In fact, they may seem to have a great deal of energy and can be very productive, needing less rest than others.<br>
            -These behaviors, which can be quite upsetting, usually prompt a family member to take notice and try to get the person help.<br>
            -Most people who are going through the manic phase of bipolar disorder deny that anything is wrong with them and refuse to see a medical professional.<br>

            Optimal treatment of bipolar disorder includes both: 
            <br> (1) medications to stabilize mood episodes and prevent future episodes 
            <br> (2) specific types of psychotherapy (talk therapy) with a licensed therapist.
            <br>
            <br> However, therapy is more successful with strong support from family and loved ones.<br>
            There is no test to determine which medication is best for an individual with bipolar disorder. Because of this, a number of medications may need to be tried before the right combination is found. Also, medications usually take weeks to have their full effect, so it is important to stay on the medications long enough (and to work with your doctor) to make sure they are working. While medication adjustments are being made, support from their friends and family can encourage the person with bipolar disorder hold on to hope while they are recovering from a mood episode.<br>
