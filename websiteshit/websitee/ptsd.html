            Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a trauma- or stressor-related disorder that can develop after exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence, according to the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5).<br>
            <br>
            Traumatic events that may trigger PTSD include:<br> 
            <br>
            -violent personal assaults<br>
            -natural or human-caused disasters<br>
            -such as terrorist attacks<br>
            -motor vehicle accidents<br>
            -rape<br>
            -physical or sexual abuse<br>
            -severe emotional abuse<br>
            -wartime violence, including military combat.<br>

            After a trauma in which you think you might die, see someone die, or become seriously injured, and you feel intense fear, helplessness, or horror, it is very common to become distressed and anxious.<br>
            You may have trouble sleeping, have nightmares, think about the trauma a lot, try to avoid the site of the trauma, and/or try to avoid feelings at all and become more numb.<br>
            When these symptoms occur shortly after the trauma, and they are severe enough to impair functioning, acute stress disorder is diagnosed.<br>
            For most people, this distressing period passes within about four weeks. PTSD is diagnosed when these symptoms continue to interfere with daily life and persist more than a month after the initial trauma.<br>

        <p>
            Most specialists who treat mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety also have experience in treating PTSD, particularly since it is a relatively common disorder.<br>
            You may find that some professional therapists and counselors (clinical psychologists, clinical social workers, professional counselors) will specialize in trauma-related disorders and have certification with some of the specific therapies, such as EMDR.<br>
            Medication treatment of PTSD is best managed by psychiatrists who have extensive training in assessing and treating these disorders.<br>
            Nurse practitioners with certification in psychiatry also have experience with PTSD treatment and work with psychiatrists.<br>
