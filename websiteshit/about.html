                    <br>
                    this idea? Ofc it was!<br>
                    <br>
                    The initiative behind this website was to raise awareness regarding<br>
                    mental health and encourage people to come forward, share their<br>
                    stories and not feel alone in the battles they are fighting in their<br>
                    everyday lives.

                    <br>
                    We hope and pray that our little effort was beneficial to you :) <br>
